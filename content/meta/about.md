(TODO: Update this page as it is quite out of date!)  
The goal of this blog is to keep you appraised of various project Chris FR and
his team have been working on and plan to work on.These projects include:

* the new free blog host [zteo.com](http://www.zteo.com),

* the open-source community software [nextbbs.com](http://www.nextbbs.com),

* various web sites in our network, such as [staffexpo.com](http://www.zteo.com) and [militate.com](http://www.militate.com),

* external collaborations such as [kittenauth](http://www.kittenauth.com) (status: dead?), [cg-arts](http://www.cg-arts.org) or [zoints](http://www.zoints.com)

* and more projects, to be addressed as the need to discuss them arises

Please note: most of these projects would be defunct, save for the help of a
fanatical team of volunteers who deserve as much credit for these projects as
Chris does. Expect to see postings from some of these great people around
here.
