As a fairly recent LG urbane owner, I felt sad that so many great faces have a
dim mode that doesn't look near as good as their bright mode.  
  
So I put together this small racket app: https://github.com/fusion/Watch-It-/releases  
  
It does the stupidest thing: it attempts to make a face's bright settings also
its dim settings.  
It will not work with protected faces and will likely also not work it a face
makes heavy usage of scripting.  
  
If you download it, let me know how it is working for you (or not!)﻿
