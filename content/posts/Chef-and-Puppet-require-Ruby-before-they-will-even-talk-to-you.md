Chef and Puppet require Ruby before they will even talk to you.

Introducing TighBeam: because it works with the same tools sysadmins use all the time. This is a personal project, not some actual open source big deal. I wrote something for myself, keeping it as small as possible. Use it too in a week-end project or what not.

**But it has a logo!**

Yes. Proof that any bunk idea can have its own branding :)
