I was totally not completely wrong to buy a mid 2010 Mac pro!  
  
...because of course right after I bought it, it was discontinued. And I
bought it for teh upgradez!  
  
Anyway, I just:  
  
1\. Upped its RAM amount to 32GB (Apple begrudgingly updated their web site to
finally admit that, yes, 8GB sticks are supported)
(<http://www.frys.com/product/8008624?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG>)  
  
2\. Switched to a 980GB Patriot Ignite SSD
(<http://frys.com/product/8358357?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG>)  
  
3\. Swapped the video card for my "old" PC's GTX660 -- not officially
supported but totally works except EFI boot. Old but still 2.5x the
performance provided by the original HD5770, plus access to
Cuda.(<http://www.frys.com/product/7551666>)  
  
In summary: I am getting the same level of upgradability as I would from a
hackintosh, for what ends up being a similar amortized cost, minus the
headaches.ï»¿
