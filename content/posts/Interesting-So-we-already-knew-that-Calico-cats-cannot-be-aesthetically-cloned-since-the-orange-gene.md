Interesting. So, we already knew that Calico cats cannot be aesthetically
cloned since the orange gene is randomly expressed yet, if I am not misusing
the lingo, spatially restricted, thus creating orange patches.  
Now, it appears that, as should be expected, extrinsic factors such as womb
temperature will have a less dramatic yet still relevant effect on other
coloring.  
  
In conclusion: I owe my wife an apology for buying into the oft made claim that cats can be visually cloned.
