Lately, too much work has gotten in the way of posting about non-work related
projects(!)  
  
So, quickly:  
  
I pushed to Github the code for my new aggregation/blogging engine:
<https://github.com/Fusion/HereNote>  
More information: <http://nexus.zteo.com/HereNote--publish-your-thoughts>  
  
Then, I wrote a init process replacement for containers such as Docker
instances: <https://github.com/Fusion/cfr_reaper>  
It doesn't do everything init do, but it keeps your containers from being
overrun with zombie processes.  
  
Also, sbase-for-android, which is obviously an Android project, is a
lightweight and MIT licensed replacement for Busybox. It is also more featured
(e.g. you can type 'ls -ltr') <https://github.com/Fusion/sbase-for-android>  
  
If you are running openvz, have a look at vcfr, which simplifies some tasks
such as installing packages, etc: <https://github.com/Fusion/vzcfr>﻿
