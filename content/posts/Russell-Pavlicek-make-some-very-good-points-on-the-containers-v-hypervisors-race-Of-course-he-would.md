Russell Pavlicek make some very good points on the containers v. hypervisors
race. Of course, he would defend hypervisors; they are his bread and butter
after all.  
  
I have to admit, though, that as I read his post, I felt that he was building
a straw man as no one is saying that hypervisors will be replaced by
containers. However... I went back to my own recent
post(<http://nexus.zteo.com/posts/the-next-evolution-of-virtualization/>), to
confirm my thinking, and re-reading my own words I realize that I totally
omitted mentioning one of my favorites things about containers: the fact that
they can cohabitate with VMs.  
  
When I refer to a future where container-specific applications would exist, I
should mention that this is tied not to hypervisors disappearing but instead
to the commoditization of VMs. I should have made this explicit.  
  
On the other hand, I still think his post is a straw man: what I hear from
containers evangelists is not that hypervisors are bloated but that VMs are:
there is a considerable nuance here as, while VMs are bound (IMO) to become a
commodity, hypervisors are going to be an increasingly important tool in a
network admin's toolbelt. However, I believe that, if you wish to take the
lead in that particular market, you should start looking into hybrid
hypervisors that support these different layers of virtualization (For future
reference: "Fractal hypervisors." \-- there, I said it)﻿
