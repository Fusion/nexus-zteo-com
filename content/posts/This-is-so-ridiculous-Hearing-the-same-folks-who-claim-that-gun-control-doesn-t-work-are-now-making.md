In case you do not understand that, the baddies do not have to use the same encryption methods as other users, either.<br /><br />Well, at least we know how to survive a face palm...﻿"

This is so ridiculous. Hearing the same folks who claim that gun control
doesn't work are now making the case that terrorists attacks could be
prevented by forcing cell phone vendors to hand over encryption keys.  
  
You have to pick one: either the bad guys go through alternative channels than
honest people, as can be the case with guns, or they don't. In case you do not
understand that, the baddies do not have to use the same encryption methods as
other users, either.  
  
Well, at least we know how to survive a face palm...﻿
