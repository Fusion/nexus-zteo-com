Beta 4 is out and it is *very* sweet. It even offers Gmail integration like
never before.

Well, if you have a _@gmail.com_ account, that is.

But don't worry! If you have a Google App account, it can be made to work with
little extra work. Here is how:  
  

1\. You need a standard _@gmail.com_ account. Create a bogus one if necessary.

2\. You will not want to do anything with this account. Not really. Thus, in
Thunderbird, go offline: **File > Offline > Work Offline**.

3\. Select **File > New > Mail Account...**

4\. Enter the information for your _@gmail.com_ account. Thunderbird will
recognize the address and automatically fill out the following box with the
correct GMail information: _imap.googlemail.com_ , etc. Green dots all around!
Just click **[Create Account]**

5\. Now, in the left-hand tree, right-click on your account name and select '
**Settings...** '

6\. Change your account name to something meaningful, then click **[OK]** \--
If you do not do this and exit the dialog, the other screens will not be
updated correctly.

7\. Re-open the dialog, select ' **Server Settings** ' and enter your Google
App email account where your _@gmail.com_ account is currently displayed.

8\. Select ' **Outgoing Server (SMTP)** ', then ' **Google Mail -
smtp.googlemail.com** ' and click **[Set Default]**

9\. Click **[OK]** , leave offline mode, restart Thunderbird to be on the safe
side.

10\. All set! Thunderbird will start synchronizing with your Google App
account using these optimum settings.
