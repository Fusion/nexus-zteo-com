I received this email today:

> **Your AdWords Google Account is stoped.**  
>  Dear Google AdWords Customer,

>

> We were unable to process your payment.  
> Your ads will be suspended soon unless we can process your payment.  
> To prevent your ads from being suspended, please update your payment
information.

>

> Please sign in  
> to your account at http://adwords.google.com/select/login,  
> and update your payment information.

Of course I got suspicious right away, when I noticed the spelling of
'stopped'. But, hey, consider yourselves warned.
