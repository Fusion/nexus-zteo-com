A quick note about [Clic!Dev](http://www.clicdev.com): it is now possible, in
the admin control panel, to select _**Setup Hacks > enable 24 hour users**_ to
add an extra information dialog to the footer of your hosted board's main
page. This will end up looking like so (but obviously adapted to whatever
skins you are using):
