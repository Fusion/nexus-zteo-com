It's a new feature! I spend way too much time reading interesting papers... I
should not be so selfish as to not share them.

[Steve Yegge's ramblings](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-
job-at-google.html) will enlighten you or depress you, but at least they are
enjoyable. There, on my list, right under [Joel
Spolsky](http://joelonsoftware.com/) (all-time Nerd Superstar).

**Clustering and Cloud Computing**

[The Helmer Cluster](http://helmer.sfe.se), but only because I can also be a
hardware nerd.  
[Dr Queue](http://drqueue.org/cwebsite/), not the only one, but a queue
manager that proved its worth.  
[Terracotta](http://www.terracotta.org) because I have a big Java project that
needs scaling and I believe that scaling out is a more...er...scalable
approach.

**Performance**

I mean **raw** performance;Ã‚Â as in scaling up, this time.  
[Tokyo Cabinet](http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net) seems to be the best
tree-based database available these days. Takes me back to when I was using
C-ISAM from Informix. NO, not all problems need a big OORDB thrown at them. In
fact, transitioning some of your data to Tokyo Cabinet seems like a good
application of "write first, optimize later."  
"How do they do it?" LinkedIn are kind enough to [expose their
architecture](http://cookiesareforclosers.com/blog/2008/06/linkedin-
architecture).  
Twitter! Sorry, no link. Oh, well, maybe [one](http://status.twitter.com/).
Oh, no, wait it's down. No it's back up! Wow, the Twitter API is currently
capped to 10 requests per hour. Application developers: keep your calls to no
more than one every 6 minutes...except for the public timeline, unless they
decide to restrict its usage as well.

**Wireframing, Blueprinting and A/B Testing**

I need to post links here. Keep an eye on this blog entry.  
Anyway, Yahoo now conveniently provides [stencils for web
mockups](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/wireframes/).

**Erlang**

It's [beautiful](http://www.erlang.org/doc/getting_started/part_frame.html).
I'm just getting started, though.

**Git**

For so-called "virtual companies" this would be the ultimate in source code
management. Even if you're not "virtual", you may want to give it a try. I
absolutely love how it allows me to try the craziest framework modifications
without having to suffer any consequence.  
[Easy Git](http://www.gnome.org/~newren/eg/) \-- "git for mere mortals"  
[Interact](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html) with
your Subversion code base - man, I want the same thing for Perforce!  
[Educate yourself](http://www.gitcasts.com/). Well, seems to work for me...

**The "If I had more time..." section**

[NestedVM](http://nestedvm.ibex.org/):Ã‚Â whatever your source language,
cross-compile to MIPS .o files, then convert to pure Java.  
Really optimized [image
colorization](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yweiss/Colorization/).
