summary: "I like things neatly organized. I absolutely hate the idea that I could buy a book I already own. So, it's not surprise that, as a Mac user, I trust Delicious Library to keep tracks of my books, DVS and video games.As an Android user, I also like that Shelves even exists. After all, it is mostly when I am walking the aisles of Barnes &amp; Noble that I am the most susceptible to wonder whether I already own a given book -- although Amazon may eventually lure me away from that experience -- and if that information is only available on my Mac happily waiting for my return back home, it's not very helpful to me. Therefore, Shelves is my saviour."

I like things neatly organized. I absolutely hate the idea that I could buy a
book I already own. So, it's not surprise that, as a Mac user, I trust
[Delicious Library](http://www.delicious-monster.com/) to keep tracks of my
books, DVS and video games.  
As an Android user, I also like that
[Shelves](http://www.shelvesforandroid.com/) even exists. After all, it is
mostly when I am walking the aisles of Barnes & Noble that I am the most
susceptible to wonder whether I already own a given book -- although Amazon
may eventually lure me away from that experience -- and if that information is
only available on my Mac happily waiting for my return back home, it's not
very helpful to me. Therefore, Shelves is my saviour.

Unfortunately, keeping Shelves updated with Delicious Library's information is
too involved a process: select export, check all the correct variables, select
separators, rename the exported file, etc. This is not a good process for the
procrastinator in me.

So, I wrote a small application -- a compiled Apple Script really -- that
queries Delicious Library's database and exports the relevant information to a
file placed on my desktop. This file is already called
'Delicious_Library_Books.txt' and I only need to copy it to my phone and re-
import it every time I add new books to my collection.

I could of course work on it some more to, for instance, handle other types of
collections, but it fits my needs as is. If there is a request for a more
complete script, I may modify it accordingly.

In the meantime, if you think it could help you, you are welcome to download
it!
