[![ExtPHP Logo](/images/extphp.thumbnail.png)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rtv/120547075/)It is something that I had to think about in my day job, because
my team is migrating to PHP for web development and I believe that we simply
do not have enough time for them to learn JavaScript's intricacies, I needed
to be the one person who would have to wrestle JavaScript when problems
happened. I therefore needed a way to insulate them from the gory details,
which is why I created ExtPHP.  
As you may have guessed from subtle hints, such as this entry's 12-feet tall
header, ExtPHP creates a PHP wrapper for [ExtJS](http://extjs.com).

![ExtPHP In Action](/images/firefoxscreensnapz001.thumbnail.jpg)I
noticed, at dzone.com, that the last time someone created a wrapper for
JavaScript, many readers complained about how intrusive his approach was.
Well, be assured that ExtPHP does not foil ExtJS' non-intrusive take. Of
course, with ExtJS itself, it's up to the developer to decide what kind of
style they wish to adopt, and ExtPHP follows suit.

![ExtPHP Doc Screenshot](/images/zz6f821753.thumbnail.jpg)I
guess the introduction I wrote in ExtPHP's documentation explains fairly
clearly what the idea is: "ExtPHP is a wrapper for ExtJS. This is version 0.1,
so I expect that a lot of things can be improved upon and your feedback is
greatly appreciated. ExtPHP can be used to write both intrusive and non-
intrusive Javascript, just like ExtJS itself. Use it responsibly. One of the
many advantages of this design is that unknown/misspelled/misused methods are
detected in your PHP editor rather than forcing you to debug your JavaScript
code in your web browser. "

Documentation? Indeed, I took some time to write a much-needed PDF document.
Let me know how I can improve it, I am sure that you will find it lacking -
because it is.

Anyway, I am releasing this as a "Technology Preview" and I will greatly
appreciate your help beta-testing it.

Cheers.
