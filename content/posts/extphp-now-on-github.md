"Day CQ5 - Workflow Editor")About 10 months ago, I released this tool,
allowing developers to handle ExtJS like "managed" code in PHP:
[ExtPHP](http://nexus.zteo.com/2008/03/04/extphp-an-extjs-converterwrapper-
for-php-developers/).

Shortly thereafter, Jack Slocum changed ExtJS' licensing model and it all
became very muddy but my main question was: "As a commercial user, what would
the status of the extensions be?"  
It seems that it's OK to create an extension and not GPL it as long as it
doesn't contain any ExtJS original code. The claim is that most extensions now
fall under that category. Of course, there is still the risk of an extension
still containing ExtJS code -- hint: that's very likely -- and the company who
paid for ExtJS commercial licensing is now burdened with...what? De-facto GPL
code? Or does the code that was reused considered "commercially licensed" as
well? Even though it is part of an open-source extension?

Ten months later, I am not getting a sense that things were clarified well
enough. Look at [this
topic](http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=33891&page=10) on ExtJS'
forums. It looks like, after September, everybody gave up.

**So, what now?**

Well, if anyone could point me to a comprehensive answer regarding this issue,
that will sure help me decide whether to revisit my decision to give up on
ExtJS from a commercial standpoint.

In the meantime, **ExtPHP is now[available at
Github](http://github.com/Fusion/extphp/tree/master)**.
