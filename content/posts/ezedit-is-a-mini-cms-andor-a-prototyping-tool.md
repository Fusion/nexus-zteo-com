Also, ezEdit is very, very, very **easy** to install and use:

You can add the **CMS** to your existing website;  
You can use it to **mock-up** updates to your site;  
If you are a web designer, you can work on updates **with your clients** in
real-time; and this is without installing anything: simply use the
bookmarklet.

ezEdit works as either a very short bootstrap **script** or a **bookmarklet**.  
The CMS back-end is in a self-contained file as well.

Currently the CMS works with static web pages but it even comes with a
**plugin** architecture that makes it easy to write extensions to update the
big guys (Drupal, Wordpress, etc.)

ezEdit is **free** , **open-source** and both community and, if demand arises
for it, commercially **supported**.

The script has **no dependencies** on additional JavaScript: because it makes
no assumption, it can cohabitate peacefully with jQuery, Prototype, YUI, etc.

Using the script is very straightforward as well: a simple **hotkey** , enter
your credentials if **security** is enabled, and start editing any part of a
web page.

**Configuration** is painless: you can even maintain an external configuration
file if you do not with to open the back-end script.  
And, yes, that is correct: you can use the front-end script without the back-
end script even being available.
