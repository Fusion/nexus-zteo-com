"Wordpress Logo")The player I used in my previous post ( 'nBBS Admin CP' ) is
now available in the Wordpress.org's plugin directory.

A quick overview:  

  

  * This plugin lets you embed a flash stream using Geoff Stearn's player.
  

  * You can embed multiple movies in the same page and/or post.
  

  * You can embed movies in posts and comments.
  

  * You can specify a width and a height to override the default values of 640x480.
  

  * I use Geoff's Javascript to work around Adobe's restriction on flash content display.
  

  
I know it's not the first Flash plugin for Wordpress...just let me know if you
have creative ideas for this little guy.
