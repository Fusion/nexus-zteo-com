![](/images/teste-300x201.png)Until now, this freebie has
been known only to my Twitter followers, but considering the positive feedback
it received, I am going to put it out there for everybody: a few months ago,
being disappointed with the lack of true rich-text editing provided by typical
blog editing tools, I started work on mine.

It's still a very unambitious thing but at least it does what every blog owner
wants: it allows you to work on your posts in a convenient and intuitive way.

The new guy is unimaginatively called 'Free Blog' and believe me it's way
better than the other potential names I came up with.

And yes, I intend to add many features to it if you guys like it.
