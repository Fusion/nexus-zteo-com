I know, it's a bold assertion. But, please, bear with me: as a longtime Unix-
head, I need a tool that allows me to zoom through my emails rather than
click-glance-click-glance-click-yawn-right-click-delete, etc.

For years I've been happy with **Mutt** because nothing compares with using
the arrow keys to navigate through my emails, ALT-O to open a folder, SHIFT-
O-R to do a reverse-sort, M for a new message, etc.  
That, and using [Visor](http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-visor/), give me
the comfort of a HUD-based email management tool whose speed is quite
unbeatable.

Unfortunately, with today's evolution of mail, everything is more or less
HTML-based, which really doesn't work well with Mutt -- even using V to open
in a text-based browser isn't that good. If I ask Mutt to open a full-fledged
browser instead, there goes the speed advantage...

So, I have reluctantly moved to a pure Google Mail solution and my experience
has been positive so far: I run GMail as a standalone program using
[Fluid](http://fluidapp.com) \-- on another platform I would use
[Prism](http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/) \-- and I can keep using
keyboard shortcuts for all my tasks!

If you wish to give it a try, start with only this subset of GMail's keyboard
shortcuts: JKEX#[ENTER]U are all you need to replicate 99% of your Mutt
experience...

**K** / **J** : cursor up/down  
 **X** : select message  
 **E** : archive messages  
 **#** : delete messages  
 **ENTER** : read message  
 **U** : back to messages list
