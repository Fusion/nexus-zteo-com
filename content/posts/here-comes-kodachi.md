![Kodachi](/images/kodachi.png) Oh, man. Jack of
all trades, master of...not many?

This week, my frustration over not finding a
[QuickSilver](http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver)-like
tool for Windows, was at an all-time high.

Do not get me wrong: Colibri and Launchy are fine tools. They just do not have
this QuickSilver-like feel that I miss so much at work.  
Fortunately, I came upon Kodachi completely by chance and I really like the
tool.

Unfortunately, there was no executable available, only source code. Obviously,
no installer either...And the project was abandoned by its original author. I
contacted the interim maintainer and created a nice installer. I also did some
clean-up.  
I may or may not offer to take over the project, depending on the feedback I
get.

Here is a video of Kodachi in action:

And of course you can download it: [thank you
SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=121332&package_id=216010).

Note: this is an alpha release. There is no guarantee that it will even work
on your machine. All I can tell you is that it will not break your PC.
