Journler...Again!

Many Mac users are aware of the now abandoned/open-sourced excellent
productivity/journaling application known as [Journler](http://journler.com/).

Philip Dow, Journler's author, is obviously a stand-up guy and felt that he
needed to work one last time on Journler to add Snow Leopard compatibility
while open-sourcing it.

Here we are now, a few years later, and many Mac enthusiasts -- me included --
still use Journler, even if it's not a daily thing. So, I forked the project
on Github and made a few minor modifications and you can now download a more
Lion and Mountain-Lion friendly version of Journler.

I want to make very clear that I am not the author of Journler and if you use
Phil's application, he's the person you need to be grateful to. Inf act, if
you enjoy Journler -- or, in my incarnation, "Journler Again," I encourage you
to [buy a license](http://www.journler.com/purchase/index.php) from Phil's site.

No, you do not have to; the application is fully functional and there is no
limit of any kind on how you can use it. It would be nice of you to buy that
license but considering you are getting very little (or no) support, it's
definitely up to you.
