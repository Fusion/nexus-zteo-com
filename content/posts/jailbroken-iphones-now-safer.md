I was reading [this article](http://lastplaceonthe.net/protect-jailbreakmecom-
jailbroken-idevice-pdf-exploited/) and, in my opinion, it got the facts right
but their conclusion is backwards:  

> Meanwhile, whilst this particular unlock is the simplest, it also carries
with it element of risk that you’re going to want to protect yourself against.

What? No that's not the correct conclusion. A conclusion that would make more
sense is that everybody is at risk until this PDF hole is patched by Apple.
Jailbroken and **non-jailbroken phones** alike.

However, if you have jailbroken your phone, you have access to a fix now as
described in the article reference above:

1\. Open Cydia  
2\. Install "PDF Loading Warner"  
3\. Reboot your phone
