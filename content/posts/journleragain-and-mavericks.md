For instance, dragging a file to Journler means that it will try to display a preview of this file and if it is not sure what type the file is, it attempts to delegate this task to Spotlight and...scene!"

As you may have noticed if using this app, any interaction with Spotlight now
causes a crash. For instance, dragging a file to Journler means that it will
try to display a preview of this file and if it is not sure what type the file
is, it attempts to delegate this task to Spotlight and...scene!

I am aware of the issue and plan on fixing it, unfortunately it is a time
consuming task and I have very little free time right now. I need to figure
out what's wrong in the Sprouted framework first and as soon as it is done, I
will release an update.
