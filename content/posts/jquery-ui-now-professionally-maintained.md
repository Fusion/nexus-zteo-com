Well, this is exciting:  

Paul Bakaus, lead jQuery UI developer, [announced today that he was
hired](http://jquery.com/blog/2008/01/23/jquery-ui-and-beyond-the-jquery-
liferay-partnership/) by Liferay, Inc., of L.A., to work full time on his
baby.

  

As an early adopter, I am very happy to see the project evolve this way. In
case you are not familiar with Liferay, they develop open-source products, so
all is well :)
