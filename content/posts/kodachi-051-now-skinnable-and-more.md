Note that when launching Kodachi, you will now see the new demo skin, called 'Bezel', that I created. If you are familiar with QuickSilver, this is certainly an interface you are already used to. If you wish to work with the old interface, simply disable the 'BezelInterface' plug-in.-	The installer now checks which version of .Net is installed on your PC, if any, and offers to install the correct version if necessary.Download Kodachi 0.5.1"

![Kodachi](/images/kodachi.png)Kodachi v0.5.1 is
out! It's good news for **developers** who want to write plug-ins or if you
wish to change the **look** and **feel** of the application:  

  

1. A demo plug-in is now included. All it does is add a new direct word to Kodachi's vocabulary: ' **Demo** '. Type it, select some action, and it will display a Growl-like notification confirming your action. A very easy starting place for budding plug-in developers.  


2. Kodachi's user **interface** is now **skinnable**. Actually this goes a bit beyond a simple skin as you can change its **behaviour** alltogether. Note that when launching Kodachi, you will now see the new demo skin, called ' **Bezel** ', that I created. If you are familiar with QuickSilver, this is certainly an interface you are already used to. If you wish to work with the old interface, simply **disable** the 'BezelInterface' plug-in.  


3. The installer now checks which version of .Net is installed on your PC, if any, and offers to install the correct version if necessary.
