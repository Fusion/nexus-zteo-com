![Kodachi](/images/kodachi.png)You can now
anonymously sync. to the bleeding edge version of Kodachi's source code at
svn://nextbbs.com/kodachi

If you do not feel like installing svn/compiling Kodachi but are still curious
about its source code, you can browse it at
<http://www.nextbbs.com/trac/kodachi/>

**Note** : if you sync. to the first check-in, you will get the version of
Kodachi that is currently downloadable. If you sync. to the next one, you will
get a new version with a temporary default interface. Yes, I am working on
adding customizable interfaces.
