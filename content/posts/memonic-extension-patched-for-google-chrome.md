[![](/images/2460905893_0c3fc213c5-300x225.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rattodisabina/2460905893/)**The
symptom is pretty simple: you click the 'Memonic' extension icon and nothing
happens. This patch aims to fix this behavior.**

A bit more than three years ago, I published here a patched version of
SuperGenPass that would work with Google Chrome. It's been, since then,
downloaded more than 1 million times.

Recently, I also published a patched version of Memonic's Android app, patched
to work with Jelly Bean.

Today, I bring you a patched version of the Memonic clipper that will work
even if you have pesky SVG objects in the page you are trying to capture.

Just **[go to this page](http://www.voilaweb.com/tools/memonicchrome.html)**
and get the patched extension (self-signed)
