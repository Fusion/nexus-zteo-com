A couple years ago, some lad going by the pseudonym of @binderskagnaes, at
[DeviantArt](http://binderskagnaes.deviantart.com/art/Blaqua-35443206),
released a set of icons on a dark background lovingly named "Blaqua."

Then, he ventured to a great forest and got devoured. Or something.  
Whatever the reason, he never created more icons, which frankly is a pity.  
I am still using his icon set in my Dock, unfortunately the set was created
before Twitter got popular, uTorrent or Evernote were released on OS X, etc.  
So, I took a few hours to re-create an original dark PSD and put together a
pack of 24 new icons.

I will create more packs if my beloved readers suggest more applications.

In the meantime, [**go get it**](http://cyansmoker.deviantart.com/art/More-Blaqua-107615954)!
