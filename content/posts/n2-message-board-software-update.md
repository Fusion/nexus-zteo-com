 _This is a cross-posting with the nextBBS support board._

Some of you already know about this but keep reading...

Development of **nextBBS v2** was steered in a new direction about two months

"n2" is the software's new code name. And the change is more than skin-deep
because it is actually the result of the merger of three different pieces of
software:

\+ wtcBB  
\+ nextBBS v2 "current"  
\+ My own PHP framework called "Lenses"

The result is a very fast, very user and admin-friendly board with easy
install and localization across the board.

This new direction is very exciting for at least two reasons:

1\. It allows me to work without being hindered by "youthful" mistakes I had

Admin Control Panel that was too intimidating

2\. **wtcBB** and **nextBBS** share a common philosophy on many levels and

examples are BBCode editor, sub-sub forums, micro-caching, high logging
