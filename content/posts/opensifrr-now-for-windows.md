![sIFR v2](/images/logo_sifr2.gif)A couple months
ago, [I made a post](2007/05/18/create-your-own-sifr-flash-files-2/) about my
new toy: **OpensIFRr** , which lets you easily create awesome Flash files that
you can use to render just about any font in your web pages.

I was pleased with the feedback it got but of course a lot of readers asked
about the Windows version.  
Well, it's here now! In the process I've learned a thing or two about
Nullsoft's Scripting Engine :)

Hope you like it and, once again, a tip of the hat to Mike Davidson & al.

"OpensIFRr")

ps: It appears that the version of swfmill that is currently working under
OpensIFRr's hood does not always like spaces; therefore if the program seems
stuck converting a font file, try again with less characters - which is good
practice anyway!
