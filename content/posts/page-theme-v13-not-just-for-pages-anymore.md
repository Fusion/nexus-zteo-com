[![](/images/2886979530_c7d00bb211_o-195x65.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wiehanne/2886979530/)I
am happy to announce the release of the Wordpress plugin "Page-Theme" v1.3.  
This version is a full rewrite.

Its features are:

* Define themes on a per-page basis

* Define themes on a per-post basis ( ** _new_** )

* Support for SEO-friendly permalinks

* Support for basic permalinks ( ** _new_** )

* Full integration with posts and pages screens in the admin control panel ( ** _new_** )

  
There should also be a lesser potential for Javascript interference as I
removed the one external script I was invoking.

## How do I use it?

  
![](/images/Dashboard-‹-The-Nexus-—-WordPress-2.png)  
In the admin control panel, under "Appearance" there is a new link: "Page
Theme"  
  
  
![](/images/Page-Theme-Options-‹-The-Nexus-—-WordPress.jpg)  
Select the checkboxes for which screen you wish to integrate the plugin with.  
  
  
![](/images/Pages-‹-The-Nexus-—-WordPress-2.jpg)  
Click on the preview picture/theme name to change it.

Select a new theme for this page or post and click on 'Set Theme'

If you already have a previous version installed, you can go through
Wordpress' update mechanism. If not, just [head to the plugin
page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/page-theme/).
