Need some work ambiance that's not just pure white noise?  
The web delivers!

Properly used, after all, noise is supposed to be our creative ally. [There is a study](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/665048) touted by various web
sites.

  
Of course, at first there was [rainymood](http://www.rainymood.com/). It
really is an excellent quality loop. In fact, the web version is, in my
opinion, superior to the mobile one, which adds a somewhat disturbing
background music.

If you find rainymood's loop not eventful enough, you could give a try to
[simply rain](http://rain.simplynoise.com/). Note that it is only one of
several loops you can listen to at the [simply
noise](http://www.simplynoise.com/) web site. Of course, the site exists
mostly to promote the iOS and Android apps which, they claim, are "the best
sound machines $0.99 can buy." I suppose it is true since [White
Noise](http://www.tmsoft.com/) is closer to $3.

Clearly, rain is considered a great white noise generator.

More recently, however, the arduous effort of walking to your local coffeeshop
became an unnecessary hindrance. Based on the study mentioned above, first
came [coffitivity](http://coffitivity.com/): A simple yet effective way to
combine a coffe house noise with your attempts at covering it up using music
in your earbuds.

Of course, the people at [rainycafe](http://rainycafe.com/) immediately saw
that keeping these ambiances separate was a grievous mistake and you can now
mix both coffeshop ambience and stormy rain sounds without needing to open as
many as _two_ web pages.

If these sound loops are too mundane for you, why not visit
[bluemars](http://rainycafe.com/) aka "Lone's ambient streams?" You can
actually listen to some pretty fantastically chill tunes. Plus, selecting
"bluemars," "cryosleep" or "voices from within" will definitely offer very
different moods.

Of course, if you wish to vary moods, you can hardly find a better place than
[focus@will](https://www.focusatwill.com/beta/). This site, currently in beta,
even encourages you to switch between different musical genres to maximize
your focus. Apparently, mobile versions will soon be available, helping you
attain their stated goal to extend your productivity cycle to 100 minutes
(from 20 to 30)

And finally, do not forget about the ultimate booming white noise loop: 90
minutes of the [USS Enterprise's engine
noise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqCoUvz_nwI&feature=player_detailpage).
