If, like me, your company's insistence on using Sharepoint as an Intranet tool
contributes to rapid neurons death, there is as least a glimmer of hope: you
can still use Firefox without being punished by having to type raw HTML code
when editing a page (Sharepoint, unsurprisingly, only likes IE)

Simple steps to use your own rich-text editor:  

  

1. Install [Xinha](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1449 "Xinha here!")
  

2. Edit SharePoint page
  

3. Right-click, select "Open Xinha here!"
  

4. Edit! then click [OK]
  

5. Now, submit page with all its HTML code. Note: You can edit existing pages as well.
  

  
Done!
