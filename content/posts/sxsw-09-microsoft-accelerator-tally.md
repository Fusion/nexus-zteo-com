 **Winners:**

[ribbit](http://www.ribbit.com) Innovative Technology  
[tubemogul](http://www.tubemogul.com) Video  
[weardrobe](http://weardrobe.com/) Social Network  
[popcuts](http://www.popcuts.com/) Music

**High hopes:**  
[moontoast](http://moontoast.com/) Very nice concept for remote learning.  
[zoomorama](http://zoomorama.com/) Very useful technology.  
[klout](http://klout.net/) Great concept but there are concerns over cost.

**Neutral:**  
[spawn labs](http://spawnlabs.com/)  
[echodio](http://echodio.com/) Impressive technology but confusion regarding
their business model.  
[gigotron](http://www.gigotron.com/) Cool app but suffers competition from
[turn2live](http://www.turn2live.com/)  
[mugasha](http://www.mugasha.com/)

**Lukewarm:**  
[otherinbox](http://otherinbox.com/) Another inbox? Why? Does it work with
Microsoft products? Are they going to sell my data?  
[cubeless](http://www.cubeless.com/) What makes you different from all the
other players in this market?  
[piryx](http://piryx.com/) Apparently the founder was a bit too
confrontational for the judges' taste.  
[motionnotes](http://motionnotes.com/) Both judges and audience were, it
seems, wondering, what their differentiators are.  
[hourville](http://hourville.com/) Successively compared to linkedin, craig's
list, guru.com... Business model not clearly articulated. Obviously these
short sessions (2mn + 10mn) are killers.
