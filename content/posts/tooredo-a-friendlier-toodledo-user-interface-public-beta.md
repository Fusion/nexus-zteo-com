I am now opening [Tooredo](/posts/tooredo-a-friendlier-toodledo-user-interface-
public-beta/tooredo.zteo.com) to public beta.  
I -- and others -- have been using it for several months without majors
glitches so I think it's time I shared the joy with you.

### What is Toodledo?

  
Toodledo -- I am not affiliated with them in any way -- is an awesome web
application that helps you write down and remember your tasks. Tasks can be
organized in folders and contexts and tagged. You can even set goals for
yourself.

What sets them apart is twofold:

1\. Their connectivity. These guys offer a great backend for storing your
tasks and an equally great API for developers to use it in their applications.

2\. Their web user interface. Either you embrace it unconditionally or you
spend lot of time wondering why they didn't choose to design a friendlier one.

As a result of #1, Toodledo is everywhere: if you are using a task manager on
your smartphone or are a GTD fan, chances are that the program you are using
at least offers the option to synchronize your data with Toodledo.

As a result of #2, I created Tooredo.

### What is Tooredo?

  
Tooredo is a more intuitive user interface to create and manage tasks lists.
It relies on Toodledo to store these tasks and you can switch between both
applications as you please. In fact, you can even switch between Tooredo,
Toodledo and your favourite task manager or even completely bypass the
Toodledo web interface if you feel like it; although, Tooredo is not as full-
featured as Toodledo's interface.

Obviously, if you wish to give Tooredo a spin, you first need to [register a free Toodledo account](http://www.toodledo.com/signup.php).  
When this is done, simply head to [tooredo.zteo.com](http://tooredo.zteo.com)
