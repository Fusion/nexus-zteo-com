Based on the very helpful feedback I received from the Twitterified client
users, here is version 1.2's log:

\- **Multiple accounts** support:  
\-- Multiple accounts using the same server  
\-- Accounts using multiple servers (Twitter, Identi.ca...)  
\-- Underlying architecture to eventually support any third-party server as
long as they are compatible  
\- Better error reporting  
\- Better error recovery  
\- **Mouse Gestures** support  
\- Tweets can now be marked " **read** "  
\- Obviously new tweets are now easily identifiable  
\- The application window height is now a setting  
\- It is now possible to " **ignore** " someone using the collapsable boxes

Due to the client's support for multiple accounts, if you are upgrading, you
will have to re-enter your credentials. It's a one-time thing.  

Note, too, that starting with v1.1, the client offers to update automatically
when a new version is out.
