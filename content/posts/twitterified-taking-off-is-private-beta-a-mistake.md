Somehow, seemingly out of nowhere, Twitterers have started to notice
[Twitterified](http://twitterified.com). I guess
[a](http://www.killerstartups.com/Social-Networking/twitterified-com-the-power-of-twitter-expanded)
[few](http://thesocialnetworker.com/tsn/tsn.nsf/dx/twitterified-the-new-air-client.htm) [positive](http://everythingtwitter.com/2008/10/31/twitterified-a-feature-rich-air-client/) [reviews](http://www.fredzone.org/twitterified-un-client-twitter-pour-echanger-des-images-des-videos-et-du-son.html) help.

But would Twitterified have received these positive reviews, had it not moved
to **open beta**? I think not. The service was in closed beta for a couple
months, which allowed me to kill a few gremlins I found in the system, but
even so it did not attract enough **adventurous** users for its own good. So,
I followed the "old" web 2.0 advice: release the product ( **early** ), even
if you feel that it is not ready. Of course, I need to keep an eye on all
feedback and **fix problem** s as soon as they are reported. I do not think
that an open beta can work any other way. Fortunately, due to the tool's
nature, feedback can be found in a very obvious place :)

I consider myself lucky because I already have some experience with scaling
applications -- thanks to _clicdev.com_ and past experience as a web host --
and as a very clueless user interface "victim" I do spend a lot of time
thinking about all the ways that an application could confuse me. But even so,
that's no reason to dwell in closed beta country. When I look around, it seems
that no matter how talented and how successful web entrepreneurs have been,
products launched as closed beta have always had **a hard time** making it as
a mainstream product.

Not that I am thinking of Twitterified's minuscule critical success as
anything mainstream, or that I would dare compare its audience to **Pownce**!
But, interestingly, when I look at Pownce and who its backers are, it doesn't
seem to have achieved the success **it seemed poised to**. Of course, I am not
singling out Pownce. It just happens to be one of the projects I found really
interesting.  
In conclusion, I do not think that I will every launch anything in closed beta
again. It's just not worth it!
