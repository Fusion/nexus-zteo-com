summary: "I cannot believe that it took me so long to get my ducks in a row.First, Twitterified was entirely written in Javascript, like most AIR clients. But some testing showed that rewriting in AS3 would dramatically increase responsiveness.Then, I had to work on my web framework while creating twitterified.com. And finally I was only able to offer a decent video thanks to the overall godness offered by Vimeo.But hey, here it is!

[![twitterified.com](/images/bluejaygif.thumbnail.gif)](http://twitterified.com/user/inviteme)I cannot believe that it took me so long to get my ducks in
a row.  
First, Twitterified was entirely written in Javascript, like most AIR clients.
But some testing showed that rewriting in AS3 would dramatically increase
responsiveness.  
Then, I had to work on my web framework while creating **twitterified.com**.
And finally I was only able to offer a decent video thanks to the overall
godness offered by Vimeo.  
But hey, here it is! For a limited period of time, if you go to [the invite page](http://twitterified.com/user/inviteme) and enter the code "nexus", you
will be automatically added to the private beta program.

Twitterified powers up your Twitter experience, allowing it to compete with
the "new kids": Pownce, Friendfeed, etc.
