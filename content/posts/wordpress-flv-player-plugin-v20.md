summary: "Close to two years ago, after quickly putting together my own FLV Player plugin for Wordpress (original post) I added it to Wordpress.org's already impressive list of plugins. Who knows? Someone else might find it useful (it's been downloaded more than 4,500 times since then so I guess that means someone did)"

"Cat  reloaded")Close to two years ago, after quickly putting together my own
FLV Player plugin for Wordpress ([original post](/2007/07/01/flv-player/)) I
added it to Wordpress.org's already impressive list of plugins. Who knows?
Someone else might find it useful (it's been downloaded more than 4,500 times
since then so I guess that means _someone_ did)

Yesterday a few people commented on that original post, thus reminding me of
that plugin. It shamed me when I revisited its packaging to find out that it
required from its users to download more pieces left and right. So, **here it
is** , brand new **v2.0** , with everything included, and this means **brand
new SWF wrapper** and **brand new Flash file**. Hope you forgive the fact that
it took me all this time to provide a real self-contained archive.

Oh, and there is something I would like to address about this plugin. It's
actually a reply to one of the comments I received recently:

> What do you mean by "a flash stream"? Does it stream an flv or use
progressive download? To stream flash, you need a streaming media server. You
should be clear and say what you mean - stop contributing to peoples'
ignorance.

  
Well, I hope it helps you feel a little less ignorant to know that the answer
is "both." This plugin can stream both types, depending on your use of a http-
type or a rtmp-type URI. It can also play live streams. More information can
be found [here](http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/faq).
