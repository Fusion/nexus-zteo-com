FreeBlog is a multi-platform tool (Linux, Windows, OS X) that helps you in
your blogging tasks.FreeBlog was born out of frustration after its author
tried various blogging software, most of it on the Mac: that type of software
usually offers all sorts of features, such as publishing which music you are
currently listening to, and seem to forget to focus on the basics: a real
rich-text editor that renders your posts as closely to what they will look
like on your weblog as possible.Only when FreeBlog's author knows that he has
all the basics right, through personal testing and more importantly, your
feedback, only then will he focus on more "flashy" features.

Intuitive  
Using FreeBlog's real rich-text editor and ultra-easy interface, you can work
on your blog posts, refine and preview them until you are completely satisfied
with your result.Every detail of its interface is here to help you focus on
your writing, not to keep you guessing. Its interface is extremely
straightforward and help bubbles are available throughout the
software.Unlimited Blogs  
Keep your blogs organized: FreeBlog supports multiple accounts, either on the
same server or spread across multiple servers.Real Rich-Text Editor  
![](/images/teste2-300x219.png)You can edit blogs using the
reach-text editor, move to a pure HTML editor, and back to the reach-text
editor completely seamlessly.Think of FreeBlog's rich-text editor as truly
"what you see if what you get": contrary to other blogging software, when you
insert an image in a post, this image is displayed in the post as you are
editing it. It would seem like an obvious behavior, and yet, to some, it's
not.  
Posts Management  
Tag your posts, publish them, recall them ("published" > "draft") and manage
their assets easily.Two Preview Modes  
![](/images/teste-300x201.png)First, a fast, simulated
preview, that lets you play with your post's layout (width, font size,
etc.Also, a full preview that uses the theme captured from your blog to
preview your post locally.Safe  
FreeBlog is built on top of Adobe's AIR platform; this means that it runs in a
sandbox: even though it accesses the Web from your computer, it will never be
able to copy that web content to your critical folders or corrupt your
important data.Can't-beat pricing  
It's free!  
So, what next?  
Your feedback is what will decide what features are added to future versions
of FreeBlog.Currently, replicating Wordpress' shortcodes in the editor itself
is under consideration, as is offline mode.FreeBlog only supports Wordpress-
based blogs. Again, depending on your feedback, this may change.It is
recommended that you [follow the author on
Twitter](http://twitter.com/chrisfr) because he will keep posting information
regarding updates to FreeBlog.
