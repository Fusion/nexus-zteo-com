A "refreshed," Lion and Mountain-Lion compatible Journler: [read the blog
post](/blog/2012/09/22/its-journler-again/ "It’s Journler…Again!")

I want to make very clear that I am not the author of Journler and if you use
Phil's application, he's the person you need to be grateful to. Inf act, if
you enjoy Journler -- or, in my incarnation, "Journler Again," I encourage you
to [buy a license](http://www.journler.com/purchase/index.php "buy a
license.") from Phil's site.

No, you do not have to; the application is fully functional and there is no
limit of any kind on how you can use it. It would be nice of you to buy that
license but considering you are getting very little (or no) support, it's
definitely up to you.

Changelist (v2.7b)

    * Lion/Mountain Lion compatibility, SDK 10.7

    * Lion Full Screen support

    * App is now fully licensed
