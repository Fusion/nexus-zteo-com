## [August 2018 update]

*Classical message boards are now a thing of the past.*
*Do not get me wrong! I am still a regular of some sites that use vBulletin (https://forums.watchuseek.com) but these are not technically evolving anymore.*

*These days, online communities have become mostly support communities and some greate software, such as [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) or [Flarum](https://flarum.org/), have made browsing and contributing simpler.*

*Look around for a couple minutes and you will also find mixed textual-audio communities and more interesting developments.*
