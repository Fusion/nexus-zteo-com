## [August 2018 Update]

*Feel free to user S2ajax if you are looking for something lightweight.*

*On the other hand, between jQuery 3, React, Angular, etc. S2's concept is definitely getting quite long in the tooth.*

![](/images/S2ajax2.png)S2ajax is a 'managed' AJAX
framework. It is derived from Sajax, written by the Modern Method folks a few
years ago.

This modern implementation allows the developer to declare classes on the
server and instantiate them on demand on the client.

Note that S2ajax combines two common computing concepts:
[FFI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface) (Foreign
Function Interface) and
[RPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) (Remote Procedure
Call)

S2ajax is available under the very permissive BSD license.
